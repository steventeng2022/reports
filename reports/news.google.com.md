## Detailed findings

### 1. [INFO] DNSSEC not authenticated (no AD flag from resolvers) (`DNS2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-399
- **Detail:** Public resolvers did not return the AD flag for this zone; DNSSEC is not enabled for the apex zone.
- **Recommendation:** Consider enabling DNSSEC for integrity protection of DNS records.

### 2. [INFO] Technology fingerprint (`TECH1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Detected: Server: ESF
- **Recommendation:** Keep the disclosed stack current and patch promptly; consider trimming verbose headers.

### 3. [INFO] HTTP upgrade advertised (Alt-Svc) (`TECH2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Alt-Svc: h3=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-29=":443"; ma=2592000
- **Recommendation:** Verify the advertised protocol endpoints are configured.

### 4. [INFO] Missing Referrer-Policy (`H5`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** No Referrer-Policy header; full URL may leak to third-party referrers.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Set Referrer-Policy (e.g., strict-origin-when-cross-origin).

### 5. [INFO] Server technology disclosure (`H6`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Header reveals: ESF
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Consider hiding or shortening the Server header.

### 6. [INFO] Missing security.txt (`P8`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1038
- **Detail:** No .well-known/security.txt found (RFC 9116).
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Publish .well-known/security.txt per RFC 9116.

### 7. [INFO] No OCSP responder URL in certificate (no stapling possible) (`OCSP3`)

- **CWE:** CWE-603
- **Detail:** Certificate of news.google.com has no Authority Information Access OCSP entry.
- **Recommendation:** Enable OCSP (and stapling) so revocation can be checked.

### 8. [INFO] HSTS present but domain not in the HSTS preload list (`HSTSP`)

- **CWE:** CWE-319
- **Detail:** Strict-Transport-Security is served but news.google.com is not listed in the HSTS preload list.
- **Recommendation:** Submit the domain to the HSTS preload list (requires includeSubDomains + long max-age).

### 9. [INFO] Cookie scoped to parent domain (.google.com) (`CK5`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Set-Cookie Domain attribute is broader than the request host news.google.com.
- **Recommendation:** Confirm the wider cookie scope is intended.

### 10. [INFO] robots.txt discloses disallowed paths (asset map) (`ROB1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** robots.txt lists 3 disallow path(s), e.g. /, /, /
- **Recommendation:** Review disallowed paths; robots is not access control.

### 11. [LOW] CSP present but still allows unsafe directives (`CSP1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1021
- **Detail:** Content-Security-Policy of news.google.com permits unsafe-inline, unsafe-eval; inline script injection still executes.
- **Recommendation:** Replace unsafe-inline/unsafe-eval with nonces, hashes, or trusted types.

### 12. [INFO] CSP reporting endpoint disclosed (`CSP2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** CSP of news.google.com includes a report-uri/report-to endpoint; the endpoint URL and its acceptance behavior are exposed.
- **Recommendation:** Verify the CSP report endpoint rate-limits and authenticates submissions.

### 13. [INFO] Reverse-DNS (PTR) fingerprint of apex IP (`PTR1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** 142.250.204.46 carries PTR lctsaa-ac-in-f14.1e100.net., hkg07s38-in-f14.1e100.net. for news.google.com.
- **Recommendation:** PTR labels can leak hosting/asset naming; review for internal-hostname exposure.

### 14. [INFO] App-association / digital-asset-links surface published (`WK1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Live JSON at /.well-known/apple-app-site-association and /.well-known/assetlinks.json on news.google.com; a mobile app or web-bridge is tied to this domain and its association configuration is public.
- **Recommendation:** Review the published association (URL teams, assets) for stale entries; watch for subdomain-takeover misuse.

### 15. [LOW] HSTS does not cover subdomains (`H21`)

- **CWE:** CWE-319
- **Detail:** Strict-Transport-Security on news.google.com has max-age >= 1 year but no includeSubDomains, so HSTS is not applied to subdomains of news.google.com.
- **Recommendation:** Add includeSubDomains (each subdomain must then serve HSTS itself).

## Notes

- All tests used a standard browser User-Agent; only GET requests and TCP-connect state checks were sent to the target.
- No injection payloads, no fuzzing, no form submissions, no authentication, and no state was modified on the target.
- DNS lookups went to public resolvers (8.8.8.8 / 1.1.1.1); subdomain data came from certificate-transparency logs (crt.sh / certspotter).
- OCSP status came from one signed OCSP request (HTTP GET) to each certificate's own AIA responder; HSTS preload membership was checked against the current Chromium static preload list (net/http/transport_security_state_static.json, fetched 2026-09-27).
- OCSP stapling presence was observed by sending one template TLS ClientHello (fresh random + session-id; only the SNI rewritten to the target) and inspecting the server's first flight for the certificate_status extension; on TLS1.2 that observation is conclusive, on TLS1.3-only servers it is recorded as inconclusive. Observe-only: no second flight, no completed handshake, no state change.
- re-run #14 passive additions: certificate hygiene is parsed from the DER the base TLS check already fetched (no extra requests); HTML-level angles read the root document already fetched for header checks; the only extra requests are read-only GETs to /.well-known/security.txt (or /security.txt), /sitemap.xml, and at most one certificate CRL distribution point.
- re-run #15 passive additions: TLS 1.0/1.1, cipher-suite and key-exchange observations come from the handshake the base TLS check already performed plus one quiet re-handshake with no HTTP traffic; HTML-level angles read the root document already fetched for header checks; the only extra request this pass is a read-only GET to /.well-known/openid-configuration (plus the earlier passes' security.txt, sitemap.xml and CRL GETs).
- Findings are reported against the public program scope; submission through the program tracker is pending.
