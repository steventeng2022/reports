## Detailed findings

### 1. [INFO] DNSSEC not authenticated (no AD flag from resolvers) (`DNS2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-399
- **Detail:** Public resolvers did not return the AD flag for this zone; DNSSEC is not enabled for the apex zone.
- **Recommendation:** Consider enabling DNSSEC for integrity protection of DNS records.

### 2. [INFO] HTTP upgrade advertised (Alt-Svc) (`TECH2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Alt-Svc: h3=":443";ma=86400,h3-29=":443";ma=86400,h3-27=":443";ma=86400
- **Recommendation:** Verify the advertised protocol endpoints are configured.

### 3. [LOW] Missing HSTS header (`H1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-319
- **Detail:** No Strict-Transport-Security header present. Browsers do not enforce HTTPS for repeat visits.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Add Strict-Transport-Security with max-age >= 31536000 and preload.

### 4. [LOW] Missing X-Content-Type-Options (`H3`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1194
- **Detail:** No nosniff directive; browsers may MIME-sniff responses.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff.

### 5. [LOW] No clickjacking protection (`H4`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1023
- **Detail:** No X-Frame-Options or CSP frame-ancestors; page can be embedded in a frame.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Set X-Frame-Options: DENY/SAMEORIGIN or CSP frame-ancestors.

### 6. [INFO] Missing Referrer-Policy (`H5`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** No Referrer-Policy header; full URL may leak to third-party referrers.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Set Referrer-Policy (e.g., strict-origin-when-cross-origin).

### 7. [INFO] Missing security.txt (`P8`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1038
- **Detail:** No .well-known/security.txt found (RFC 9116).
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Publish .well-known/security.txt per RFC 9116.

### 8. [INFO] Third-party verification tokens in apex TXT records (`DNS5`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Apex TXT records with verification/token content: google-site-verification=rvdr5o5Pu2N2R1s_amIscEqKs1DVEjCIDvzkBJ7We5o
- **Recommendation:** Review published verification records; they confirm domain ownership to third parties.

### 9. [INFO] No OCSP responder URL in certificate (no stapling possible) (`OCSP3`)

- **CWE:** CWE-603
- **Detail:** Certificate of forms.gle has no Authority Information Access OCSP entry.
- **Recommendation:** Enable OCSP (and stapling) so revocation can be checked.

### 10. [LOW] CSP present but still allows unsafe directives (`CSP1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1021
- **Detail:** Content-Security-Policy of forms.gle permits unsafe-inline, unsafe-eval; inline script injection still executes.
- **Recommendation:** Replace unsafe-inline/unsafe-eval with nonces, hashes, or trusted types.

### 11. [INFO] CSP reporting endpoint disclosed (`CSP2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** CSP of forms.gle includes a report-uri/report-to endpoint; the endpoint URL and its acceptance behavior are exposed.
- **Recommendation:** Verify the CSP report endpoint rate-limits and authenticates submissions.

### 12. [INFO] App-association / digital-asset-links surface published (`WK1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Live JSON at /.well-known/apple-app-site-association and /.well-known/assetlinks.json on forms.gle; a mobile app or web-bridge is tied to this domain and its association configuration is public.
- **Recommendation:** Review the published association (URL teams, assets) for stale entries; watch for subdomain-takeover misuse.

### 13. [INFO] No CAA record (any CA may issue) (`DNS7`)

- **CWE:** CWE-295
- **Detail:** No CAA record found for forms.gle, so any public CA can issue a certificate for the zone.
- **Recommendation:** Publish a CAA record (issue; <CA>) to constrain which CAs may issue for the domain.

### 14. [INFO] Edge advertises HTTP/3 (QUIC) via alt-svc (`H23`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** The root response of forms.gle carries alt-svc h3=":443";ma=86400,h3-29=":443";ma=86400,h3-27=":443";ma=86400; QUIC/HTTP3 is enabled at the edge (protocol + port inventory).
- **Recommendation:** Confirm the QUIC port/endpoint is intended and monitored.

### 15. [INFO] Edge/CDN layer identified from response headers (`H26`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Response headers on forms.gle identify the edge as Fastly; the CDN tier (caching, WAF, protocol handling) is part of the attack surface and should be inventoried.
- **Recommendation:** Keep the CDN tier in the asset inventory and verify its security policy (WAF/cache) is reviewed.

## Notes

- All tests used a standard browser User-Agent; only GET requests and TCP-connect state checks were sent to the target.
- No injection payloads, no fuzzing, no form submissions, no authentication, and no state was modified on the target.
- DNS lookups went to public resolvers (8.8.8.8 / 1.1.1.1); subdomain data came from certificate-transparency logs (crt.sh / certspotter).
- OCSP status came from one signed OCSP request (HTTP GET) to each certificate's own AIA responder; HSTS preload membership was checked against the current Chromium static preload list (net/http/transport_security_state_static.json, fetched 2026-09-27).
- OCSP stapling presence was observed by sending one template TLS ClientHello (fresh random + session-id; only the SNI rewritten to the target) and inspecting the server's first flight for the certificate_status extension; on TLS1.2 that observation is conclusive, on TLS1.3-only servers it is recorded as inconclusive. Observe-only: no second flight, no completed handshake, no state change.
- re-run #14 passive additions: certificate hygiene is parsed from the DER the base TLS check already fetched (no extra requests); HTML-level angles read the root document already fetched for header checks; the only extra requests are read-only GETs to /.well-known/security.txt (or /security.txt), /sitemap.xml, and at most one certificate CRL distribution point.
- re-run #15 passive additions: TLS 1.0/1.1, cipher-suite and key-exchange observations come from the handshake the base TLS check already performed plus one quiet re-handshake with no HTTP traffic; HTML-level angles read the root document already fetched for header checks; the only extra request this pass is a read-only GET to /.well-known/openid-configuration (plus the earlier passes' security.txt, sitemap.xml and CRL GETs).
- re-run #16 passive additions: the edge/protocol angles read the alt-svc, server-timing and CDN-identification headers from the one root GET; the preconnect/dns-prefetch, base-href and noindex angles parse the already-fetched root document; the TLS 1.2-only ceiling, SHA-1 signature and weak-key angles use the certificate evidence the base TLS check already captured; the only extra requests this pass are two read-only GETs (/.well-known/jwks.json and /.well-known/change-password).
- Findings are reported against the public program scope; submission through the program tracker is pending.
