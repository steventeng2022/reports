## Detailed findings

### 1. [INFO] DNSSEC not authenticated (no AD flag from resolvers) (`DNS2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-399
- **Detail:** Public resolvers did not return the AD flag for this zone; DNSSEC is not enabled for the apex zone.
- **Recommendation:** Consider enabling DNSSEC for integrity protection of DNS records.

### 2. [LOW] No DMARC record (`MAIL3`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** No _dmarc TXT record published; receivers cannot enforce DMARC policy for this domain.
- **Recommendation:** Publish a DMARC record (start with p=none, then quarantine).

### 3. [MEDIUM] TLS certificate chain not trusted (`TLS1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-298
- **Detail:** TLS verification failed: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED
- **Recommendation:** Fix the certificate chain (missing intermediate / issuer).

### 4. [MEDIUM] FTP service (cleartext) reachable (`PRT21`)

- **CWE:** CWE-319
- **Detail:** TCP connect to 31.31.197.110:21 succeeded (state-only check, no payload sent).
- **Recommendation:** If the service is not required publicly, close the port or restrict by network.

### 5. [INFO] SSH reachable (`PRT22`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** TCP connect to 31.31.197.110:22 succeeded (state-only check, no payload sent).
- **Recommendation:** If the service is not required publicly, close the port or restrict by network.

### 6. [INFO] SMTP (port 25) reachable (`PRT25`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** TCP connect to 31.31.197.110:25 succeeded (state-only check, no payload sent).
- **Recommendation:** If the service is not required publicly, close the port or restrict by network.

### 7. [INFO] POP3 (cleartext) reachable (`PRT110`)

- **CWE:** CWE-319
- **Detail:** TCP connect to 31.31.197.110:110 succeeded (state-only check, no payload sent).
- **Recommendation:** If the service is not required publicly, close the port or restrict by network.

### 8. [INFO] IMAP (cleartext) reachable (`PRT143`)

- **CWE:** CWE-319
- **Detail:** TCP connect to 31.31.197.110:143 succeeded (state-only check, no payload sent).
- **Recommendation:** If the service is not required publicly, close the port or restrict by network.

### 9. [INFO] IMAPS (port 993) reachable (`PRT993`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** TCP connect to 31.31.197.110:993 succeeded (state-only check, no payload sent).
- **Recommendation:** If the service is not required publicly, close the port or restrict by network.

### 10. [INFO] POP3S (port 995) reachable (`PRT995`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** TCP connect to 31.31.197.110:995 succeeded (state-only check, no payload sent).
- **Recommendation:** If the service is not required publicly, close the port or restrict by network.

### 11. [MEDIUM] MySQL (port 3306) reachable (`PRT3306`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** TCP connect to 31.31.197.110:3306 succeeded (state-only check, no payload sent).
- **Recommendation:** If the service is not required publicly, close the port or restrict by network.

### 12. [LOW] SPF record has no explicit all mechanism (implicit +all) (`MAIL6`)

- **CWE:** CWE-285
- **Detail:** Without -all/~all/+all the SPF record implicitly authorizes all senders.
- **Recommendation:** End the SPF record with -all or ~all.

### 13. [INFO] No MTA-STS record (_mta-sts) - opportunistic TLS not enforced (`MAIL11`)

- **CWE:** CWE-223
- **Detail:** Domain sends mail (MX present) but publishes no MTA-STS policy (RFC 8461).
- **Recommendation:** Consider MTA-STS to require TLS to known MTAs.

### 14. [INFO] No TLS-RPT record (_smtp._tls) (`MAIL13`)

- **CWE:** CWE-223
- **Detail:** No TLS-RPT policy for SMTP TLS reporting (RFC 8451/8452).
- **Recommendation:** Consider TLS-RPT for TLS delivery reporting.

### 15. [INFO] No OCSP responder URL in certificate (no stapling possible) (`OCSP3`)

- **CWE:** CWE-603
- **Detail:** Certificate of reacts.ru has no Authority Information Access OCSP entry.
- **Recommendation:** Enable OCSP (and stapling) so revocation can be checked.

### 16. [INFO] No CAA record (any CA may issue) (`DNS7`)

- **CWE:** CWE-295
- **Detail:** No CAA record found for reacts.ru, so any public CA can issue a certificate for the zone.
- **Recommendation:** Publish a CAA record (issue; <CA>) to constrain which CAs may issue for the domain.

## Notes

- All tests used a standard browser User-Agent; only GET requests and TCP-connect state checks were sent to the target.
- No injection payloads, no fuzzing, no form submissions, no authentication, and no state was modified on the target.
- DNS lookups went to public resolvers (8.8.8.8 / 1.1.1.1); subdomain data came from certificate-transparency logs (crt.sh / certspotter).
- OCSP status came from one signed OCSP request (HTTP GET) to each certificate's own AIA responder; HSTS preload membership was checked against the current Chromium static preload list (net/http/transport_security_state_static.json, fetched 2026-09-27).
- OCSP stapling presence was observed by sending one template TLS ClientHello (fresh random + session-id; only the SNI rewritten to the target) and inspecting the server's first flight for the certificate_status extension; on TLS1.2 that observation is conclusive, on TLS1.3-only servers it is recorded as inconclusive. Observe-only: no second flight, no completed handshake, no state change.
- re-run #14 passive additions: certificate hygiene is parsed from the DER the base TLS check already fetched (no extra requests); HTML-level angles read the root document already fetched for header checks; the only extra requests are read-only GETs to /.well-known/security.txt (or /security.txt), /sitemap.xml, and at most one certificate CRL distribution point.
- re-run #15 passive additions: TLS 1.0/1.1, cipher-suite and key-exchange observations come from the handshake the base TLS check already performed plus one quiet re-handshake with no HTTP traffic; HTML-level angles read the root document already fetched for header checks; the only extra request this pass is a read-only GET to /.well-known/openid-configuration (plus the earlier passes' security.txt, sitemap.xml and CRL GETs).
- re-run #16 passive additions: the edge/protocol angles read the alt-svc, server-timing and CDN-identification headers from the one root GET; the preconnect/dns-prefetch, base-href and noindex angles parse the already-fetched root document; the TLS 1.2-only ceiling, SHA-1 signature and weak-key angles use the certificate evidence the base TLS check already captured; the only extra requests this pass are two read-only GETs (/.well-known/jwks.json and /.well-known/change-password).
- re-run #17 passive additions: the retired-header angles (Public-Key-Pins, Expect-CT, X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies, Via, COOP/COEP, Permissions-Policy) read from the one root GET; the wildcard SAN, http:// OCSP and 398-day-cap angles use the certificate evidence the base TLS check already captured (SAN now harvested from the existing DER); the only extra requests this pass are three read-only GETs (/.well-known/dpop-jwks.json, /.well-known/origin-rsa-keys.json, /.well-known/llms.txt).
- Findings are reported against the public program scope; submission through the program tracker is pending.
