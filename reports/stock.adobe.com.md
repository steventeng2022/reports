## Detailed findings

### 1. [INFO] DNSSEC not authenticated (no AD flag from resolvers) (`DNS2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-399
- **Detail:** Public resolvers did not return the AD flag for this zone; DNSSEC is not enabled for the apex zone.
- **Recommendation:** Consider enabling DNSSEC for integrity protection of DNS records.

### 2. [LOW] Missing CSP header (`H2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1021
- **Detail:** No Content-Security-Policy header. XSS mitigation relies solely on output encoding.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Add a Content-Security-Policy header (start with default-src and report-only).

### 3. [LOW] No clickjacking protection (`H4`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1023
- **Detail:** No X-Frame-Options or CSP frame-ancestors; page can be embedded in a frame.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Set X-Frame-Options: DENY/SAMEORIGIN or CSP frame-ancestors.

### 4. [INFO] Missing Referrer-Policy (`H5`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** No Referrer-Policy header; full URL may leak to third-party referrers.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Set Referrer-Policy (e.g., strict-origin-when-cross-origin).

### 5. [INFO] Missing Permissions-Policy (`H7`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** No Permissions-Policy header gating browser powerful features (camera, geolocation, ...).
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Add a Permissions-Policy restricting unused features.

### 6. [INFO] No cross-origin isolation headers (COOP/COEP) (`H8`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** COOP/COEP not set; the page is not isolated from cross-origin documents.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Consider COOP/COEP if the site uses sharedArrayBuffer or wants isolation.

### 7. [LOW] CORS: external origin accepted with credentials (`CORS3`)

- **CWE:** CWE-942
- **Detail:** Origin https://evil-auditor.example -> Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://evil-auditor.example, Allow-Credentials: true.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Validate origins and avoid echoing arbitrary origins with credentials.

### 8. [LOW] CORS: subdomain origin origin accepted with credentials (`CORS1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-942
- **Detail:** Origin https://sub.stock.adobe.com -> Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://sub.stock.adobe.com, Allow-Credentials: true.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Validate origins and avoid echoing arbitrary origins with credentials.

### 9. [INFO] Missing security.txt (`P8`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1038
- **Detail:** No .well-known/security.txt found (RFC 9116).
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Publish .well-known/security.txt per RFC 9116.

### 10. [INFO] No MTA-STS record (_mta-sts) - opportunistic TLS not enforced (`MAIL11`)

- **CWE:** CWE-223
- **Detail:** Domain sends mail (MX present) but publishes no MTA-STS policy (RFC 8461).
- **Recommendation:** Consider MTA-STS to require TLS to known MTAs.

### 11. [INFO] No TLS-RPT record (_smtp._tls) (`MAIL13`)

- **CWE:** CWE-223
- **Detail:** No TLS-RPT policy for SMTP TLS reporting (RFC 8451/8452).
- **Recommendation:** Consider TLS-RPT for TLS delivery reporting.

### 12. [INFO] No OCSP responder URL in certificate (no stapling possible) (`OCSP3`)

- **CWE:** CWE-603
- **Detail:** Certificate of stock.adobe.com has no Authority Information Access OCSP entry.
- **Recommendation:** Enable OCSP (and stapling) so revocation can be checked.

### 13. [INFO] HSTS present but domain not in the HSTS preload list (`HSTSP`)

- **CWE:** CWE-319
- **Detail:** Strict-Transport-Security is served but stock.adobe.com is not listed in the HSTS preload list.
- **Recommendation:** Submit the domain to the HSTS preload list (requires includeSubDomains + long max-age).

### 14. [INFO] Cookie scoped to parent domain (.adobe.com) (`CK5`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Set-Cookie Domain attribute is broader than the request host stock.adobe.com.
- **Recommendation:** Confirm the wider cookie scope is intended.

### 15. [INFO] robots.txt discloses disallowed paths (asset map) (`ROB1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** robots.txt lists 73 disallow path(s), e.g. /, /, /, /, /
- **Recommendation:** Review disallowed paths; robots is not access control.

### 16. [INFO] No CAA record (any CA may issue) (`DNS7`)

- **CWE:** CWE-295
- **Detail:** No CAA record found for stock.adobe.com; apex adobe.com, so any public CA can issue a certificate for the zone.
- **Recommendation:** Publish a CAA record (issue; <CA>) to constrain which CAs may issue for the domain.

### 17. [INFO] Third-party <script> loaded without Subresource Integrity (`HTML2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-345
- **Detail:** Root document of stock.adobe.com loads 1 cross-origin script(s) without an integrity attribute, e.g. https://ct.captcha-delivery.com/c.js; a compromise of any such third-party host can inject code.
- **Recommendation:** Add SRI integrity attributes or self-host critical scripts.

### 18. [INFO] Edge/CDN layer identified from response headers (`H26`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Response headers on stock.adobe.com identify the edge as Fastly; the CDN tier (caching, WAF, protocol handling) is part of the attack surface and should be inventoried.
- **Recommendation:** Keep the CDN tier in the asset inventory and verify its security policy (WAF/cache) is reviewed.

## Notes

- All tests used a standard browser User-Agent; only GET requests and TCP-connect state checks were sent to the target.
- No injection payloads, no fuzzing, no form submissions, no authentication, and no state was modified on the target.
- DNS lookups went to public resolvers (8.8.8.8 / 1.1.1.1); subdomain data came from certificate-transparency logs (crt.sh / certspotter).
- OCSP status came from one signed OCSP request (HTTP GET) to each certificate's own AIA responder; HSTS preload membership was checked against the current Chromium static preload list (net/http/transport_security_state_static.json, fetched 2026-09-27).
- OCSP stapling presence was observed by sending one template TLS ClientHello (fresh random + session-id; only the SNI rewritten to the target) and inspecting the server's first flight for the certificate_status extension; on TLS1.2 that observation is conclusive, on TLS1.3-only servers it is recorded as inconclusive. Observe-only: no second flight, no completed handshake, no state change.
- re-run #14 passive additions: certificate hygiene is parsed from the DER the base TLS check already fetched (no extra requests); HTML-level angles read the root document already fetched for header checks; the only extra requests are read-only GETs to /.well-known/security.txt (or /security.txt), /sitemap.xml, and at most one certificate CRL distribution point.
- re-run #15 passive additions: TLS 1.0/1.1, cipher-suite and key-exchange observations come from the handshake the base TLS check already performed plus one quiet re-handshake with no HTTP traffic; HTML-level angles read the root document already fetched for header checks; the only extra request this pass is a read-only GET to /.well-known/openid-configuration (plus the earlier passes' security.txt, sitemap.xml and CRL GETs).
- re-run #16 passive additions: the edge/protocol angles read the alt-svc, server-timing and CDN-identification headers from the one root GET; the preconnect/dns-prefetch, base-href and noindex angles parse the already-fetched root document; the TLS 1.2-only ceiling, SHA-1 signature and weak-key angles use the certificate evidence the base TLS check already captured; the only extra requests this pass are two read-only GETs (/.well-known/jwks.json and /.well-known/change-password).
- Findings are reported against the public program scope; submission through the program tracker is pending.
