## Scope and authorization

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Target | https://t.qq.com/ |
| Bug bounty program | Tencent |
| Listed scope domain | t.qq.com |
| Test date | 2026-09-26 19:00 UTC |
| Method | Non-aggressive: passive recon (DNS records incl. wildcard/CNAME-chain detection, DNSSEC, SPF/DMARC/MTA-STS/TLS-RPT mail-policy analysis, certificate-transparency subdomains) + read-only active checks (HTTP(S) headers, cookie flags incl. HttpOnly, CORS with Origin header, GET-only open-redirect/redirect-loop/Host-header-reflection probes, GET-only sensitive-path checks, robots.txt asset map, TCP-connect port state, TLS protocol/cipher/certificate DER analysis incl. OCSP revocation status and SNI fallback, certificate validity-window checks, HSTS preload-list membership, CSP directive analysis, cacheable-document header analysis, compound Secure+SameSite cookie gaps, single-nameserver risk, PTR reverse-record fingerprint). No injection, no fuzzing, no forms, no auth, no state changes. |

## Summary

Total findings: **1** (High: 0, Medium: 0, Low: 0, Info: 1)

| # | Severity | ID | Finding | CWE |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | info | DNS2 | DNSSEC not authenticated (no AD flag from resolvers) | CWE-399 |

## Detailed findings

### 1. [INFO] DNSSEC not authenticated (no AD flag from resolvers) (`DNS2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-399
- **Detail:** Public resolvers did not return the AD flag for this zone; DNSSEC is not enabled for the apex zone.
- **Recommendation:** Consider enabling DNSSEC for integrity protection of DNS records.

## Notes

- All tests used a standard browser User-Agent; only GET requests and TCP-connect state checks were sent to the target.
- No injection payloads, no fuzzing, no form submissions, no authentication, and no state was modified on the target.
- DNS lookups went to public resolvers (8.8.8.8 / 1.1.1.1); subdomain data came from certificate-transparency logs (crt.sh / certspotter).
- OCSP status came from one signed OCSP request (HTTP GET) to each certificate's own AIA responder; HSTS preload membership was checked against the current Chromium static preload list (net/http/transport_security_state_static.json, fetched 2026-09-27).
- Findings are reported against the public program scope; submission through the program tracker is pending.
