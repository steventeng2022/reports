## Detailed findings

### 1. [INFO] DNSSEC not authenticated (no AD flag from resolvers) (`DNS2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-399
- **Detail:** Public resolvers did not return the AD flag for this zone; DNSSEC is not enabled for the apex zone.
- **Recommendation:** Consider enabling DNSSEC for integrity protection of DNS records.

### 2. [LOW] No DMARC record (`MAIL3`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** No _dmarc TXT record published; receivers cannot enforce DMARC policy for this domain.
- **Recommendation:** Publish a DMARC record (start with p=none, then quarantine).

### 3. [INFO] Technology fingerprint (`TECH1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Detected: Server: ESF
- **Recommendation:** Keep the disclosed stack current and patch promptly; consider trimming verbose headers.

### 4. [INFO] HTTP upgrade advertised (Alt-Svc) (`TECH2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Alt-Svc: h3=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-29=":443"; ma=2592000
- **Recommendation:** Verify the advertised protocol endpoints are configured.

### 5. [INFO] Missing Referrer-Policy (`H5`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** No Referrer-Policy header; full URL may leak to third-party referrers.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Set Referrer-Policy (e.g., strict-origin-when-cross-origin).

### 6. [INFO] Missing Permissions-Policy (`H7`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** No Permissions-Policy header gating browser powerful features (camera, geolocation, ...).
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Add a Permissions-Policy restricting unused features.

### 7. [INFO] No cross-origin isolation headers (COOP/COEP) (`H8`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** COOP/COEP not set; the page is not isolated from cross-origin documents.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Consider COOP/COEP if the site uses sharedArrayBuffer or wants isolation.

### 8. [INFO] Server technology disclosure (`H6`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Header reveals: ESF
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Consider hiding or shortening the Server header.

### 9. [INFO] Missing security.txt (`P8`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1038
- **Detail:** No .well-known/security.txt found (RFC 9116).
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Publish .well-known/security.txt per RFC 9116.

### 10. [LOW] SPF record has no explicit all mechanism (implicit +all) (`MAIL6`)

- **CWE:** CWE-285
- **Detail:** Without -all/~all/+all the SPF record implicitly authorizes all senders.
- **Recommendation:** End the SPF record with -all or ~all.

### 11. [INFO] No MTA-STS record (_mta-sts) - opportunistic TLS not enforced (`MAIL11`)

- **CWE:** CWE-223
- **Detail:** Domain sends mail (MX present) but publishes no MTA-STS policy (RFC 8461).
- **Recommendation:** Consider MTA-STS to require TLS to known MTAs.

### 12. [INFO] No TLS-RPT record (_smtp._tls) (`MAIL13`)

- **CWE:** CWE-223
- **Detail:** No TLS-RPT policy for SMTP TLS reporting (RFC 8451/8452).
- **Recommendation:** Consider TLS-RPT for TLS delivery reporting.

### 13. [INFO] No OCSP responder URL in certificate (no stapling possible) (`OCSP3`)

- **CWE:** CWE-603
- **Detail:** Certificate of keep.google.com has no Authority Information Access OCSP entry.
- **Recommendation:** Enable OCSP (and stapling) so revocation can be checked.

### 14. [INFO] HSTS present but domain not in the HSTS preload list (`HSTSP`)

- **CWE:** CWE-319
- **Detail:** Strict-Transport-Security is served but keep.google.com is not listed in the HSTS preload list.
- **Recommendation:** Submit the domain to the HSTS preload list (requires includeSubDomains + long max-age).

### 15. [LOW] CSP present but still allows unsafe directives (`CSP1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1021
- **Detail:** Content-Security-Policy of keep.google.com permits unsafe-inline, unsafe-eval; inline script injection still executes.
- **Recommendation:** Replace unsafe-inline/unsafe-eval with nonces, hashes, or trusted types.

### 16. [INFO] CSP reporting endpoint disclosed (`CSP2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** CSP of keep.google.com includes a report-uri/report-to endpoint; the endpoint URL and its acceptance behavior are exposed.
- **Recommendation:** Verify the CSP report endpoint rate-limits and authenticates submissions.

### 17. [INFO] Reverse-DNS (PTR) fingerprint of apex IP (`PTR1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** 142.250.204.46 carries PTR hkg07s38-in-f14.1e100.net., lctsaa-ac-in-f14.1e100.net. for keep.google.com.
- **Recommendation:** PTR labels can leak hosting/asset naming; review for internal-hostname exposure.

### 18. [LOW] HTTPS root redirects to a different domain (`RD2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** https://keep.google.com/ answered 302 with Location: https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=memento&passive=1209600&continue=https://keep.google.com/&followup=https://keep.google.com/&ltmpl=keep (cross-domain handoff at the entry point).
- **Recommendation:** Review the cross-domain redirect; it discloses the real entry point and can be abused in open-redirect-style flows.

### 19. [INFO] App-association / digital-asset-links surface published (`WK1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Live JSON at /.well-known/assetlinks.json on keep.google.com; a mobile app or web-bridge is tied to this domain and its association configuration is public.
- **Recommendation:** Review the published association (URL teams, assets) for stale entries; watch for subdomain-takeover misuse.

## Notes

- All tests used a standard browser User-Agent; only GET requests and TCP-connect state checks were sent to the target.
- No injection payloads, no fuzzing, no form submissions, no authentication, and no state was modified on the target.
- DNS lookups went to public resolvers (8.8.8.8 / 1.1.1.1); subdomain data came from certificate-transparency logs (crt.sh / certspotter).
- OCSP status came from one signed OCSP request (HTTP GET) to each certificate's own AIA responder; HSTS preload membership was checked against the current Chromium static preload list (net/http/transport_security_state_static.json, fetched 2026-09-27).
- OCSP stapling presence was observed by sending one template TLS ClientHello (fresh random + session-id; only the SNI rewritten to the target) and inspecting the server's first flight for the certificate_status extension; on TLS1.2 that observation is conclusive, on TLS1.3-only servers it is recorded as inconclusive. Observe-only: no second flight, no completed handshake, no state change.
- re-run #14 passive additions: certificate hygiene is parsed from the DER the base TLS check already fetched (no extra requests); HTML-level angles read the root document already fetched for header checks; the only extra requests are read-only GETs to /.well-known/security.txt (or /security.txt), /sitemap.xml, and at most one certificate CRL distribution point.
- Findings are reported against the public program scope; submission through the program tracker is pending.
