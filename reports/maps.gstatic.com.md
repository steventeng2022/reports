## Detailed findings

### 1. [INFO] DNSSEC not authenticated (no AD flag from resolvers) (`DNS2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-399
- **Detail:** Public resolvers did not return the AD flag for this zone; DNSSEC is not enabled for the apex zone.
- **Recommendation:** Consider enabling DNSSEC for integrity protection of DNS records.

### 2. [INFO] Technology fingerprint (`TECH1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Detected: Server: sffe
- **Recommendation:** Keep the disclosed stack current and patch promptly; consider trimming verbose headers.

### 3. [INFO] HTTP upgrade advertised (Alt-Svc) (`TECH2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Alt-Svc: h3=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-29=":443"; ma=2592000
- **Recommendation:** Verify the advertised protocol endpoints are configured.

### 4. [LOW] Missing HSTS header (`H1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-319
- **Detail:** No Strict-Transport-Security header present. Browsers do not enforce HTTPS for repeat visits.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Add Strict-Transport-Security with max-age >= 31536000 and preload.

### 5. [LOW] Missing CSP header (`H2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1021
- **Detail:** No Content-Security-Policy header. XSS mitigation relies solely on output encoding.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Add a Content-Security-Policy header (start with default-src and report-only).

### 6. [LOW] No clickjacking protection (`H4`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1023
- **Detail:** No X-Frame-Options or CSP frame-ancestors; page can be embedded in a frame.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Set X-Frame-Options: DENY/SAMEORIGIN or CSP frame-ancestors.

### 7. [INFO] Missing Referrer-Policy (`H5`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** No Referrer-Policy header; full URL may leak to third-party referrers.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Set Referrer-Policy (e.g., strict-origin-when-cross-origin).

### 8. [INFO] Missing Permissions-Policy (`H7`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** No Permissions-Policy header gating browser powerful features (camera, geolocation, ...).
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Add a Permissions-Policy restricting unused features.

### 9. [INFO] No cross-origin isolation headers (COOP/COEP) (`H8`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** COOP/COEP not set; the page is not isolated from cross-origin documents.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Consider COOP/COEP if the site uses sharedArrayBuffer or wants isolation.

### 10. [INFO] Server technology disclosure (`H6`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Header reveals: sffe
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Consider hiding or shortening the Server header.

### 11. [INFO] Missing security.txt (`P8`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1038
- **Detail:** No .well-known/security.txt found (RFC 9116).
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Publish .well-known/security.txt per RFC 9116.

### 12. [INFO] No OCSP responder URL in certificate (no stapling possible) (`OCSP3`)

- **CWE:** CWE-603
- **Detail:** Certificate of maps.gstatic.com has no Authority Information Access OCSP entry.
- **Recommendation:** Enable OCSP (and stapling) so revocation can be checked.

### 13. [INFO] robots.txt discloses disallowed paths (asset map) (`ROB1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** robots.txt lists 193 disallow path(s), e.g. /search, /groups, /images, /catalogs, /catalogues
- **Recommendation:** Review disallowed paths; robots is not access control.

### 14. [INFO] Reverse-DNS (PTR) fingerprint of apex IP (`PTR1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** 173.194.174.94 carries PTR td-in-f94.1e100.net. for maps.gstatic.com.
- **Recommendation:** PTR labels can leak hosting/asset naming; review for internal-hostname exposure.

### 15. [INFO] Edge advertises HTTP/3 (QUIC) via alt-svc (`H23`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** The root response of maps.gstatic.com carries alt-svc h3=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-29=":443"; ma=2592000; QUIC/HTTP3 is enabled at the edge (protocol + port inventory).
- **Recommendation:** Confirm the QUIC port/endpoint is intended and monitored.

### 16. [INFO] Wildcard SAN on the leaf certificate (`TLS30`)

- **CWE:** CWE-298
- **Detail:** The leaf certificate of maps.gstatic.com contains wildcard SAN entry(ies) *.gstatic.com, *.metric.gstatic.com; a single key compromise or mis-issuance covers every subdomain of that name.
- **Recommendation:** Prefer per-host certificates for high-value subdomains (auth, API, admin).

## Notes

- All tests used a standard browser User-Agent; only GET requests and TCP-connect state checks were sent to the target.
- No injection payloads, no fuzzing, no form submissions, no authentication, and no state was modified on the target.
- DNS lookups went to public resolvers (8.8.8.8 / 1.1.1.1); subdomain data came from certificate-transparency logs (crt.sh / certspotter).
- OCSP status came from one signed OCSP request (HTTP GET) to each certificate's own AIA responder; HSTS preload membership was checked against the current Chromium static preload list (net/http/transport_security_state_static.json, fetched 2026-09-27).
- OCSP stapling presence was observed by sending one template TLS ClientHello (fresh random + session-id; only the SNI rewritten to the target) and inspecting the server's first flight for the certificate_status extension; on TLS1.2 that observation is conclusive, on TLS1.3-only servers it is recorded as inconclusive. Observe-only: no second flight, no completed handshake, no state change.
- re-run #14 passive additions: certificate hygiene is parsed from the DER the base TLS check already fetched (no extra requests); HTML-level angles read the root document already fetched for header checks; the only extra requests are read-only GETs to /.well-known/security.txt (or /security.txt), /sitemap.xml, and at most one certificate CRL distribution point.
- re-run #15 passive additions: TLS 1.0/1.1, cipher-suite and key-exchange observations come from the handshake the base TLS check already performed plus one quiet re-handshake with no HTTP traffic; HTML-level angles read the root document already fetched for header checks; the only extra request this pass is a read-only GET to /.well-known/openid-configuration (plus the earlier passes' security.txt, sitemap.xml and CRL GETs).
- re-run #16 passive additions: the edge/protocol angles read the alt-svc, server-timing and CDN-identification headers from the one root GET; the preconnect/dns-prefetch, base-href and noindex angles parse the already-fetched root document; the TLS 1.2-only ceiling, SHA-1 signature and weak-key angles use the certificate evidence the base TLS check already captured; the only extra requests this pass are two read-only GETs (/.well-known/jwks.json and /.well-known/change-password).
- re-run #17 passive additions: the retired-header angles (Public-Key-Pins, Expect-CT, X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies, Via, COOP/COEP, Permissions-Policy) read from the one root GET; the wildcard SAN, http:// OCSP and 398-day-cap angles use the certificate evidence the base TLS check already captured (SAN now harvested from the existing DER); the only extra requests this pass are three read-only GETs (/.well-known/dpop-jwks.json, /.well-known/origin-rsa-keys.json, /.well-known/llms.txt).
- Findings are reported against the public program scope; submission through the program tracker is pending.
