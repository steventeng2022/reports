# Security Audit Report — flavors.me

## Scope and authorization

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Target | https://flavors.me/ |
| Bug bounty program | top-websites gist (no active program match) |
| Listed scope domain | flavors.me |
| Test date | 2026-09-25 09:45 UTC |
| Method | Non-aggressive: passive recon (DNS records, DNSSEC, SPF/DMARC, certificate-transparency subdomains) + read-only active checks (HTTP(S) headers, cookie flags, CORS with Origin header, GET-only open-redirect probes, GET-only sensitive-path checks, TCP-connect port state, TLS certificate/protocol/cipher analysis). No injection, no fuzzing, no forms, no auth, no state changes. |

## Summary

Total findings: **1** (High: 0, Medium: 0, Low: 0, Info: 1)

| # | Severity | ID | Finding | CWE |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | info | DNS1 | Domain does not resolve (no A/AAAA) | CWE-200 |

## Detailed findings

### 1. [INFO] Domain does not resolve (no A/AAAA) (`DNS1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** No A or AAAA record returned from public resolvers; site may be offline or DNS-only outage.
- **Recommendation:** Confirm the service is still expected to be live.

## Notes

- All tests used a standard browser User-Agent; only GET requests and TCP-connect state checks were sent to the target.
- No injection payloads, no fuzzing, no form submissions, no authentication, and no state was modified on the target.
- DNS lookups went to public resolvers (8.8.8.8 / 1.1.1.1); subdomain data came from certificate-transparency logs (crt.sh / certspotter).
- Findings are reported against the public program scope; submission through the program tracker is pending.
