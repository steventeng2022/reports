## Detailed findings

### 1. [INFO] DNSSEC not authenticated (no AD flag from resolvers) (`DNS2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-399
- **Detail:** Public resolvers did not return the AD flag for this zone; DNSSEC is not enabled for the apex zone.
- **Recommendation:** Consider enabling DNSSEC for integrity protection of DNS records.

### 2. [INFO] Technology fingerprint (`TECH1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Detected: Server: nginx
- **Recommendation:** Keep the disclosed stack current and patch promptly; consider trimming verbose headers.

### 3. [LOW] Missing CSP header (`H2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1021
- **Detail:** No Content-Security-Policy header. XSS mitigation relies solely on output encoding.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Add a Content-Security-Policy header (start with default-src and report-only).

### 4. [LOW] Missing X-Content-Type-Options (`H3`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1194
- **Detail:** No nosniff directive; browsers may MIME-sniff responses.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff.

### 5. [LOW] No clickjacking protection (`H4`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1023
- **Detail:** No X-Frame-Options or CSP frame-ancestors; page can be embedded in a frame.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Set X-Frame-Options: DENY/SAMEORIGIN or CSP frame-ancestors.

### 6. [INFO] Missing Referrer-Policy (`H5`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** No Referrer-Policy header; full URL may leak to third-party referrers.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Set Referrer-Policy (e.g., strict-origin-when-cross-origin).

### 7. [INFO] Missing Permissions-Policy (`H7`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** No Permissions-Policy header gating browser powerful features (camera, geolocation, ...).
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Add a Permissions-Policy restricting unused features.

### 8. [INFO] No cross-origin isolation headers (COOP/COEP) (`H8`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** COOP/COEP not set; the page is not isolated from cross-origin documents.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Consider COOP/COEP if the site uses sharedArrayBuffer or wants isolation.

### 9. [INFO] Server technology disclosure (`H6`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Header reveals: nginx
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Consider hiding or shortening the Server header.

### 10. [INFO] Missing security.txt (`P8`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1038
- **Detail:** No .well-known/security.txt found (RFC 9116).
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Publish .well-known/security.txt per RFC 9116.

### 11. [INFO] HSTS present but domain not in the HSTS preload list (`HSTSP`)

- **CWE:** CWE-319
- **Detail:** Strict-Transport-Security is served but about.fb.com is not listed in the HSTS preload list.
- **Recommendation:** Submit the domain to the HSTS preload list (requires includeSubDomains + long max-age).

### 12. [INFO] robots.txt discloses disallowed paths (asset map) (`ROB1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** robots.txt lists 2 disallow path(s), e.g. /*/search/, Sitemap:
- **Recommendation:** Review disallowed paths; robots is not access control.

### 13. [LOW] HTTPS root redirects to a different domain (`RD2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** https://about.fb.com/ answered 301 with Location: https://about.facebook.com/ (cross-domain handoff at the entry point).
- **Recommendation:** Review the cross-domain redirect; it discloses the real entry point and can be abused in open-redirect-style flows.

### 14. [INFO] Error-page technology fingerprint (`ERR1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** GET /xksrfp8i4kmej8.html -> 404; error page/headers match: Nginx, WordPress.
- **Recommendation:** Trim error-page banners/headers so stack details are not disclosed on error responses.

### 15. [INFO] No CAA record (any CA may issue) (`DNS7`)

- **CWE:** CWE-295
- **Detail:** No CAA record found for about.fb.com; apex fb.com, so any public CA can issue a certificate for the zone.
- **Recommendation:** Publish a CAA record (issue; <CA>) to constrain which CAs may issue for the domain.

### 16. [INFO] OCSP stapling not offered (cert has an OCSP URL) (`TLS19`)

- **CWE:** CWE-298
- **Detail:** The about.fb.com certificate lists an AIA OCSP responder (http://ocsp.digicert.com) but no certificate_status extension was observed in a TLS 1.2 handshake; clients must query the CA themselves (or skip revocation checks).
- **Recommendation:** Enable OCSP stapling (e.g. ssl_stapling) so revocation status is served without client->CA round-trips.

### 17. [LOW] HSTS does not cover subdomains (`H21`)

- **CWE:** CWE-319
- **Detail:** Strict-Transport-Security on about.fb.com has max-age >= 1 year but no includeSubDomains, so HSTS is not applied to subdomains of about.fb.com.
- **Recommendation:** Add includeSubDomains (each subdomain must then serve HSTS itself).

### 18. [INFO] sitemap.xml discloses an indexed URL inventory (`SIT1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** /sitemap.xml on about.fb.com lists 1001 <loc> URL(s); the public URL inventory helps passive reconnaissance.
- **Recommendation:** Review the sitemap for stale/unintended URLs; keep it minimal.

### 19. [INFO] Edge/CDN layer identified from response headers (`H26`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Response headers on about.fb.com identify the edge as Fastly; the CDN tier (caching, WAF, protocol handling) is part of the attack surface and should be inventoried.
- **Recommendation:** Keep the CDN tier in the asset inventory and verify its security policy (WAF/cache) is reviewed.

### 20. [INFO] 2 hostnames found via Certificate Transparency (certspotter) (`CT1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Notable hostnames: none flagged
- **Recommendation:** Review all CT hostnames (including historical ones) for forgotten/stale assets.

## Notes

- All tests used a standard browser User-Agent; only GET requests and TCP-connect state checks were sent to the target.
- No injection payloads, no fuzzing, no form submissions, no authentication, and no state was modified on the target.
- DNS lookups went to public resolvers (8.8.8.8 / 1.1.1.1); subdomain data came from certificate-transparency logs (crt.sh / certspotter).
- OCSP status came from one signed OCSP request (HTTP GET) to each certificate's own AIA responder; HSTS preload membership was checked against the current Chromium static preload list (net/http/transport_security_state_static.json, fetched 2026-09-27).
- OCSP stapling presence was observed by sending one template TLS ClientHello (fresh random + session-id; only the SNI rewritten to the target) and inspecting the server's first flight for the certificate_status extension; on TLS1.2 that observation is conclusive, on TLS1.3-only servers it is recorded as inconclusive. Observe-only: no second flight, no completed handshake, no state change.
- re-run #14 passive additions: certificate hygiene is parsed from the DER the base TLS check already fetched (no extra requests); HTML-level angles read the root document already fetched for header checks; the only extra requests are read-only GETs to /.well-known/security.txt (or /security.txt), /sitemap.xml, and at most one certificate CRL distribution point.
- re-run #15 passive additions: TLS 1.0/1.1, cipher-suite and key-exchange observations come from the handshake the base TLS check already performed plus one quiet re-handshake with no HTTP traffic; HTML-level angles read the root document already fetched for header checks; the only extra request this pass is a read-only GET to /.well-known/openid-configuration (plus the earlier passes' security.txt, sitemap.xml and CRL GETs).
- re-run #16 passive additions: the edge/protocol angles read the alt-svc, server-timing and CDN-identification headers from the one root GET; the preconnect/dns-prefetch, base-href and noindex angles parse the already-fetched root document; the TLS 1.2-only ceiling, SHA-1 signature and weak-key angles use the certificate evidence the base TLS check already captured; the only extra requests this pass are two read-only GETs (/.well-known/jwks.json and /.well-known/change-password).
- Findings are reported against the public program scope; submission through the program tracker is pending.
