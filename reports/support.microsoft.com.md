## Detailed findings

### 1. [INFO] DNSSEC not authenticated (no AD flag from resolvers) (`DNS2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-399
- **Detail:** Public resolvers did not return the AD flag for this zone; DNSSEC is not enabled for the apex zone.
- **Recommendation:** Consider enabling DNSSEC for integrity protection of DNS records.

### 2. [LOW] Missing X-Content-Type-Options (`H3`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1194
- **Detail:** No nosniff directive; browsers may MIME-sniff responses.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff.

### 3. [INFO] Missing Referrer-Policy (`H5`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** No Referrer-Policy header; full URL may leak to third-party referrers.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Set Referrer-Policy (e.g., strict-origin-when-cross-origin).

### 4. [INFO] Missing Permissions-Policy (`H7`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** No Permissions-Policy header gating browser powerful features (camera, geolocation, ...).
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Add a Permissions-Policy restricting unused features.

### 5. [INFO] No cross-origin isolation headers (COOP/COEP) (`H8`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** COOP/COEP not set; the page is not isolated from cross-origin documents.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Consider COOP/COEP if the site uses sharedArrayBuffer or wants isolation.

### 6. [INFO] Missing security.txt (`P8`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1038
- **Detail:** No .well-known/security.txt found (RFC 9116).
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Publish .well-known/security.txt per RFC 9116.

### 7. [INFO] OCSP endpoint unreachable or returned an error (`OCSP2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-603
- **Detail:** OCSP check via http://oneocsp.microsoft.com/ocsp -> http-400
- **Recommendation:** Verify the OCSP responder is operational so clients can check revocation.

### 8. [INFO] HSTS present but domain not in the HSTS preload list (`HSTSP`)

- **CWE:** CWE-319
- **Detail:** Strict-Transport-Security is served but support.microsoft.com is not listed in the HSTS preload list.
- **Recommendation:** Submit the domain to the HSTS preload list (requires includeSubDomains + long max-age).

### 9. [INFO] robots.txt discloses disallowed paths (asset map) (`ROB1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** robots.txt lists 34 disallow path(s), e.g. /default.aspx/kb/, /default.aspx/ph/, /mats/?diagid=100001&eulaaccept=yes*, /mats/default.aspx?diagid=100001&eulaaccept=yes*, /search/default.aspx?*
- **Recommendation:** Review disallowed paths; robots is not access control.

### 10. [LOW] HSTS does not cover subdomains (`H21`)

- **CWE:** CWE-319
- **Detail:** Strict-Transport-Security on support.microsoft.com has max-age >= 1 year but no includeSubDomains, so HSTS is not applied to subdomains of support.microsoft.com.
- **Recommendation:** Add includeSubDomains (each subdomain must then serve HSTS itself).

### 11. [INFO] Edge/CDN layer identified from response headers (`H26`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Response headers on support.microsoft.com identify the edge as Azure Front Door / Fastly; the CDN tier (caching, WAF, protocol handling) is part of the attack surface and should be inventoried.
- **Recommendation:** Keep the CDN tier in the asset inventory and verify its security policy (WAF/cache) is reviewed.

### 12. [INFO] OCSP responder URL uses plaintext http:// (`TLS31`)

- **CWE:** CWE-319
- **Detail:** The OCSP URL in the leaf certificate of support.microsoft.com is http://oneocsp.microsoft.com/ocsp; OCSP requests and responses travel unencrypted.
- **Recommendation:** Publish an https:// OCSP responder URL.

## Notes

- All tests used a standard browser User-Agent; only GET requests and TCP-connect state checks were sent to the target.
- No injection payloads, no fuzzing, no form submissions, no authentication, and no state was modified on the target.
- DNS lookups went to public resolvers (8.8.8.8 / 1.1.1.1); subdomain data came from certificate-transparency logs (crt.sh / certspotter).
- OCSP status came from one signed OCSP request (HTTP GET) to each certificate's own AIA responder; HSTS preload membership was checked against the current Chromium static preload list (net/http/transport_security_state_static.json, fetched 2026-09-27).
- OCSP stapling presence was observed by sending one template TLS ClientHello (fresh random + session-id; only the SNI rewritten to the target) and inspecting the server's first flight for the certificate_status extension; on TLS1.2 that observation is conclusive, on TLS1.3-only servers it is recorded as inconclusive. Observe-only: no second flight, no completed handshake, no state change.
- re-run #14 passive additions: certificate hygiene is parsed from the DER the base TLS check already fetched (no extra requests); HTML-level angles read the root document already fetched for header checks; the only extra requests are read-only GETs to /.well-known/security.txt (or /security.txt), /sitemap.xml, and at most one certificate CRL distribution point.
- re-run #15 passive additions: TLS 1.0/1.1, cipher-suite and key-exchange observations come from the handshake the base TLS check already performed plus one quiet re-handshake with no HTTP traffic; HTML-level angles read the root document already fetched for header checks; the only extra request this pass is a read-only GET to /.well-known/openid-configuration (plus the earlier passes' security.txt, sitemap.xml and CRL GETs).
- re-run #16 passive additions: the edge/protocol angles read the alt-svc, server-timing and CDN-identification headers from the one root GET; the preconnect/dns-prefetch, base-href and noindex angles parse the already-fetched root document; the TLS 1.2-only ceiling, SHA-1 signature and weak-key angles use the certificate evidence the base TLS check already captured; the only extra requests this pass are two read-only GETs (/.well-known/jwks.json and /.well-known/change-password).
- re-run #17 passive additions: the retired-header angles (Public-Key-Pins, Expect-CT, X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies, Via, COOP/COEP, Permissions-Policy) read from the one root GET; the wildcard SAN, http:// OCSP and 398-day-cap angles use the certificate evidence the base TLS check already captured (SAN now harvested from the existing DER); the only extra requests this pass are three read-only GETs (/.well-known/dpop-jwks.json, /.well-known/origin-rsa-keys.json, /.well-known/llms.txt).
- Findings are reported against the public program scope; submission through the program tracker is pending.
