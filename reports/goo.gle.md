## Detailed findings

### 1. [INFO] DNSSEC not authenticated (no AD flag from resolvers) (`DNS2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-399
- **Detail:** Public resolvers did not return the AD flag for this zone; DNSSEC is not enabled for the apex zone.
- **Recommendation:** Consider enabling DNSSEC for integrity protection of DNS records.

### 2. [INFO] Technology fingerprint (`TECH1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Detected: Server: nginx
- **Recommendation:** Keep the disclosed stack current and patch promptly; consider trimming verbose headers.

### 3. [INFO] HTTP upgrade advertised (Alt-Svc) (`TECH2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Alt-Svc: h3=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-29=":443"; ma=2592000
- **Recommendation:** Verify the advertised protocol endpoints are configured.

### 4. [LOW] Weak HSTS (max-age < 1 year) (`H1b`)

- **CWE:** CWE-319
- **Detail:** HSTS present but max-age=1209600 (< 31536000).
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Increase max-age to at least 31536000; add includeSubDomains/preload.

### 5. [LOW] Missing CSP header (`H2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1021
- **Detail:** No Content-Security-Policy header. XSS mitigation relies solely on output encoding.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Add a Content-Security-Policy header (start with default-src and report-only).

### 6. [LOW] Missing X-Content-Type-Options (`H3`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1194
- **Detail:** No nosniff directive; browsers may MIME-sniff responses.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff.

### 7. [INFO] Missing Referrer-Policy (`H5`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** No Referrer-Policy header; full URL may leak to third-party referrers.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Set Referrer-Policy (e.g., strict-origin-when-cross-origin).

### 8. [INFO] Missing Permissions-Policy (`H7`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** No Permissions-Policy header gating browser powerful features (camera, geolocation, ...).
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Add a Permissions-Policy restricting unused features.

### 9. [INFO] No cross-origin isolation headers (COOP/COEP) (`H8`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** COOP/COEP not set; the page is not isolated from cross-origin documents.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Consider COOP/COEP if the site uses sharedArrayBuffer or wants isolation.

### 10. [INFO] Server technology disclosure (`H6`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Header reveals: nginx
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Consider hiding or shortening the Server header.

### 11. [INFO] Soft redirect (302/303) for HTTP to HTTPS (`RED2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-319
- **Detail:** http:// root answered 302 -> https://goo.gle/.
- **Context:** https response, /
- **Recommendation:** Use 301/308 for permanent scheme upgrades.

### 12. [INFO] No OCSP responder URL in certificate (no stapling possible) (`OCSP3`)

- **CWE:** CWE-603
- **Detail:** Certificate of goo.gle has no Authority Information Access OCSP entry.
- **Recommendation:** Enable OCSP (and stapling) so revocation can be checked.

### 13. [LOW] Host header reflected into redirect Location (`RED10`)

- **CWE:** CWE-601
- **Detail:** GET with Host: evil-auditor.example -> Location: https://bitly.com/pages/landing/branded-short-domains-powered-by-bitly?bsd=evil-auditor.example
- **Recommendation:** Validate redirect targets against the expected host.

### 14. [INFO] Reverse-DNS (PTR) fingerprint of apex IP (`PTR1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** 67.199.248.13 carries PTR cname.bitly.com. for goo.gle.
- **Recommendation:** PTR labels can leak hosting/asset naming; review for internal-hostname exposure.

### 15. [LOW] HTTPS root redirects to a different domain (`RD2`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** https://goo.gle/ answered 301 with Location: https://www.google.com (cross-domain handoff at the entry point).
- **Recommendation:** Review the cross-domain redirect; it discloses the real entry point and can be abused in open-redirect-style flows.

### 16. [INFO] App-association / digital-asset-links surface published (`WK1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** Live JSON at /.well-known/apple-app-site-association and /.well-known/assetlinks.json on goo.gle; a mobile app or web-bridge is tied to this domain and its association configuration is public.
- **Recommendation:** Review the published association (URL teams, assets) for stale entries; watch for subdomain-takeover misuse.

### 17. [INFO] security.txt published with a contact address (`SEC1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-1038
- **Detail:** /security.txt on goo.gle is live and contains a contact (email/URL); the security contact endpoint is publicly disclosed.
- **Recommendation:** Confirm the published contact is current and monitored (RFC 9116).

### 18. [INFO] Edge advertises HTTP/3 (QUIC) via alt-svc (`H23`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** The root response of goo.gle carries alt-svc h3=":443"; ma=2592000; QUIC/HTTP3 is enabled at the edge (protocol + port inventory).
- **Recommendation:** Confirm the QUIC port/endpoint is intended and monitored.

## Notes

- All tests used a standard browser User-Agent; only GET requests and TCP-connect state checks were sent to the target.
- No injection payloads, no fuzzing, no form submissions, no authentication, and no state was modified on the target.
- DNS lookups went to public resolvers (8.8.8.8 / 1.1.1.1); subdomain data came from certificate-transparency logs (crt.sh / certspotter).
- OCSP status came from one signed OCSP request (HTTP GET) to each certificate's own AIA responder; HSTS preload membership was checked against the current Chromium static preload list (net/http/transport_security_state_static.json, fetched 2026-09-27).
- OCSP stapling presence was observed by sending one template TLS ClientHello (fresh random + session-id; only the SNI rewritten to the target) and inspecting the server's first flight for the certificate_status extension; on TLS1.2 that observation is conclusive, on TLS1.3-only servers it is recorded as inconclusive. Observe-only: no second flight, no completed handshake, no state change.
- re-run #14 passive additions: certificate hygiene is parsed from the DER the base TLS check already fetched (no extra requests); HTML-level angles read the root document already fetched for header checks; the only extra requests are read-only GETs to /.well-known/security.txt (or /security.txt), /sitemap.xml, and at most one certificate CRL distribution point.
- re-run #15 passive additions: TLS 1.0/1.1, cipher-suite and key-exchange observations come from the handshake the base TLS check already performed plus one quiet re-handshake with no HTTP traffic; HTML-level angles read the root document already fetched for header checks; the only extra request this pass is a read-only GET to /.well-known/openid-configuration (plus the earlier passes' security.txt, sitemap.xml and CRL GETs).
- re-run #16 passive additions: the edge/protocol angles read the alt-svc, server-timing and CDN-identification headers from the one root GET; the preconnect/dns-prefetch, base-href and noindex angles parse the already-fetched root document; the TLS 1.2-only ceiling, SHA-1 signature and weak-key angles use the certificate evidence the base TLS check already captured; the only extra requests this pass are two read-only GETs (/.well-known/jwks.json and /.well-known/change-password).
- Findings are reported against the public program scope; submission through the program tracker is pending.
