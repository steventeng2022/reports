## Summary

| # | Severity | ID | Finding | CWE |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | info | DNS1 | Domain does not resolve (no A/AAAA) | CWE-200 |
| 2 | info | MAIL1 | Mail servers exist (MX) but no SPF record | CWE-200 |
| 3 | low | MAIL3 | No DMARC record | CWE-200 |
| 4 | info | MAIL11 | No MTA-STS record (_mta-sts) - opportunistic TLS not enforced | CWE-223 |
| 5 | info | MAIL13 | No TLS-RPT record (_smtp._tls) | CWE-223 |
| 6 | info | DNS7 | No CAA record (any CA may issue) | CWE-295 |

## Detailed findings

### 1. [INFO] Domain does not resolve (no A/AAAA) (`DNS1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** No A or AAAA record returned from public resolvers; site may be offline or DNS-only outage.
- **Recommendation:** Confirm the service is still expected to be live.

### 2. [INFO] Mail servers exist (MX) but no SPF record (`MAIL1`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** MX records are published but no SPF TXT record; sender-domain spoofing is harder to validate.
- **Recommendation:** Publish an SPF record enumerating authorized senders.

### 3. [LOW] No DMARC record (`MAIL3`)

- **CWE:** CWE-200
- **Detail:** No _dmarc TXT record published; receivers cannot enforce DMARC policy for this domain.
- **Recommendation:** Publish a DMARC record (start with p=none, then quarantine).

### 4. [INFO] No MTA-STS record (_mta-sts) - opportunistic TLS not enforced (`MAIL11`)

- **CWE:** CWE-223
- **Detail:** Domain sends mail (MX present) but publishes no MTA-STS policy (RFC 8461).
- **Recommendation:** Consider MTA-STS to require TLS to known MTAs.

### 5. [INFO] No TLS-RPT record (_smtp._tls) (`MAIL13`)

- **CWE:** CWE-223
- **Detail:** No TLS-RPT policy for SMTP TLS reporting (RFC 8451/8452).
- **Recommendation:** Consider TLS-RPT for TLS delivery reporting.

### 6. [INFO] No CAA record (any CA may issue) (`DNS7`)

- **CWE:** CWE-295
- **Detail:** No CAA record found for beian.gov.cn; apex gov.cn, so any public CA can issue a certificate for the zone.
- **Recommendation:** Publish a CAA record (issue; <CA>) to constrain which CAs may issue for the domain.

## Notes

- All tests used a standard browser User-Agent; only GET requests and TCP-connect state checks were sent to the target.
- No injection payloads, no fuzzing, no form submissions, no authentication, and no state was modified on the target.
- DNS lookups went to public resolvers (8.8.8.8 / 1.1.1.1); subdomain data came from certificate-transparency logs (crt.sh / certspotter).
- OCSP status came from one signed OCSP request (HTTP GET) to each certificate's own AIA responder; HSTS preload membership was checked against the current Chromium static preload list (net/http/transport_security_state_static.json, fetched 2026-09-27).
- OCSP stapling presence was observed by sending one template TLS ClientHello (fresh random + session-id; only the SNI rewritten to the target) and inspecting the server's first flight for the certificate_status extension; on TLS1.2 that observation is conclusive, on TLS1.3-only servers it is recorded as inconclusive. Observe-only: no second flight, no completed handshake, no state change.
- re-run #14 passive additions: certificate hygiene is parsed from the DER the base TLS check already fetched (no extra requests); HTML-level angles read the root document already fetched for header checks; the only extra requests are read-only GETs to /.well-known/security.txt (or /security.txt), /sitemap.xml, and at most one certificate CRL distribution point.
- re-run #15 passive additions: TLS 1.0/1.1, cipher-suite and key-exchange observations come from the handshake the base TLS check already performed plus one quiet re-handshake with no HTTP traffic; HTML-level angles read the root document already fetched for header checks; the only extra request this pass is a read-only GET to /.well-known/openid-configuration (plus the earlier passes' security.txt, sitemap.xml and CRL GETs).
- Findings are reported against the public program scope; submission through the program tracker is pending.
